This project focuses on displaying information about various countries worldwide using the restcountries API and free map services like Google Maps or Leaflet. The user can search for a country by name, retrieve information about it, and view its map using geographical coordinates. Additionally, neighboring countries are displayed with their respective codes.

### Requirements:
- Free API for country data: [restcountries API](https://restcountries.com)
- Free map service to display geographic locations, such as Google Maps or Leaflet.

## Features:
1. Country Search - Users can search for a country by name.
2. Country Information:
    - Country Flag
    - Capital City
    - Population
    - Official Languages
3. Country Map - A map of the country is shown using Google Maps or Leaflet, with the zoom set to display the entire country.
4. Neighboring Countries - Displaying the country codes of neighboring countries with links to their pages.

## How it works:

### API:
- The restcountries API allows fetching country information by name, country code, or geographic region.
- The data returned by the API includes the country's name, flag, capital city, population, languages, and geographic data (like coordinates).

### Search:
- Users can search for a country by name.
- If the country exists, it will display details including flag, capital city, population, and languages.
- If the country is not found, a message saying "Country not known" will be shown.

### Neighboring Countries:
- After displaying the country, neighboring countries' country codes (or names) will be shown.
- Clicking on a country code/name will display the corresponding countryâ€™s page.

### Map:
- The map is displayed with the country's coordinates.
- The map zoom will be set to show the entire country (e.g., if the user searches for France, the map will show all of France).

## Technologies:
- HTML and CSS for page design.
- JavaScript (ES6) with modules and Async/Await for API interaction and various functions.
- Google Maps or Leaflet for displaying the country's map.
- restcountries API for fetching country information.
